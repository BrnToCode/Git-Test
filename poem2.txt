True inner joy is self â€“ created.
It does not depend on outer circumstances.
A river is flowing in and through you carrying the message of joy.
This divine joy is the sole purpose of life.

The mind chases happiness.
The heart creates happiness.
The soul is happiness
And it spreads happiness
All-where.
